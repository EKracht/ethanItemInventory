Inventory Manager

This app will allow you to add rooms and add items in those rooms. The rooms will be added to the bottom of the list, and the items will be added to the bottom of the list for that room. You can also delete rooms and items. You are able to see what items are in different rooms with a value and description of each item.

If you would like to see a list of all of the objects in my rooms or items, please click the links at the top.

This app use express and mongo on the backend and jquery for the frontend.

I am sorry for the reloads on item additions.

Thank you and have a nice day.
